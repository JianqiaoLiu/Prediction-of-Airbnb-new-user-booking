## Introduction
In the 21st century, the development of internet provides a window for people to know
more about this colorful world, which drives them to desire to go to different cities they
like. Compared with the past, they’re willing to spend money on travelling to enjoy
their life with the improvement of people’s living standards. This leads to rising demand
for travelling house booking. In order to solve this problem, Airbnb put up with an
innovative idea --- providing a platform for travelers to book empty rooms in hosts’
houses. This attracts a lot of users because it can not only reduce the cost of travelers,
but also make full use of empty space of hosts.
Now, there are more than 150 billion travelers and 640,000 hosts in Airbnb. Their serve
region covers 190 countries and 65000 cities (Smith, 2018). With more and more users,
Airbnb hosted a recruitment competition, which requires to predict which country or
city that the users will like to choose for their first booking by machine learning
methods.
Our project aims at using different algorithms (Logistic Regression, Tree, SVM,
XGBoost) to develop models to identify users’ behavior patterns. By comparing those
results, we will choose the best one for predicting new users’ first booking destination
of Airbnb.
This project can help to predict the most desirable travel destination for guests, followed
by a lot of benefits. First of all, it can assist Airbnb to customize personal travel plan
for traveler. What’s more, by providing the most desirable destination, it will motivate
them to book within less time, which can increase booking rate. Beyond that, this kind
of service can establish a good reputation of Airbnb so that they can attract more users.
As for travelers, this can reduce their time for searching and deciding their destinations.
As for hosts, this can help them to make strategies of location choice.
